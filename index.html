        <h1>Full-Stack Web Developer</h1>

        <p>
          I am a full stack web developer, specializing in front-end
          development. I developed a passion for programming for the simple
          reason that I can get into
          <em>flow</em>, in sports they call it "being in the zone" where you
          are completely focused on the task at hand and time just melts away. I
          was teaching myself how to program for a few months before I joined
          Coding Dojo's bootcamp in Fall of 2018. They gave me a solid
          foundation in communication, problem solving, and, most importantly,
          googling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've structured my projects with my latest work on the top. I've done
          so to show my progress as a developer, both in presentation and code
          structure.
